### CPSC 120 Lab

* Lab 04
    Lab 4 was a memorable lab for me because it was the first lab I did where it was moderately difficult, but I enjoyed completing this lab because I enjoyed the challenge. Learning how to use if/else statements was difficult at first, but became easy after I grasped how to do it. Completing this lab was the first time I finished a lab feeling confident in my abilities.
* Lab 09
    I liked Lab 9 because it really did feel like all of the things we had been learning in the past weeks were coming together in this assignment. Lab 9, conversely, was a very difficult lab for me because I had been struggling to grasp a lot of the concepts in it for a while, whether it be static casts or counters. Finishing it helped me break through the wall I had kept hitting.
* Lab 10
     Lab 10 was great because of how complex all of the things we were doing were. It was nice to see a semi-complex program that I coded run properly. However, complexity was also the difficult part of the lab, as it was in Lab 9 as well, and it took me time to learn how to properly use bools and figuring out the logic behind 2D vectors, and converting and reversing strings.
